# Space Impact

This is my very first programing project in python. I coded it back in 2017 as a programing exercise after learning python for the first time. It's a simple 2D game made using Pygame library. The player can control a spaceship up or down and shoot down incoming enemy spaceships. The game idea was borrowed from the famous mobile game "Space Impact" in Nokia phones, hence the name remained the same in its honor.

# How to run

Create a virtual environment and install the rquired package (pygame) in your environment. Activate the environment and then run the `Space_impact.py` file.

```
python Space_impact.py
```

# How to play
Press `Up` arrow to move up

Press `down` arrow to move down

Press `space` to shoot

This is a do or die situation solder! Either you keep fighting or you die. (Crashing your spaceship into enemy ships or letting five enemy ships to pass you is the only way to quit to the main menu)
